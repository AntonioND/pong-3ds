This is far from complete. Actually, it's just a test to see if I could manage to setup a correct perspective for stereoscopic 3D.

I haven't used hardware accelerated graphics because I couldn't manage to compile any shader assembler (except from Picasso, but it's a bit outdated).

I made this 3D software engine for GBA, so there are still a few files from Tonc's library for GBA.

Oh, the 3D slider actually does something when you change its position.
